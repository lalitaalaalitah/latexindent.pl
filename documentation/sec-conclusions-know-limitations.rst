Conclusions and known limitations
=================================

There are a number of known limitations of the script, and almost certainly quite a few that are
*unknown*!

The main limitation is to do with the alignment routine discussed in
:ref:`page lst:aligndelims:advanced <lst:aligndelims:advanced>`; for example, consider the file
given in :numref:`lst:matrix2`.

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/matrix2.tex
 	:class: .tex
 	:caption: ``matrix2.tex`` 
 	:name: lst:matrix2

The default output is given in :numref:`lst:matrix2-default`, and it is clear that the alignment
routine has not worked as hoped, but it is *expected*.

.. literalinclude:: demonstrations/matrix2-default.tex
 	:class: .tex
 	:caption: ``matrix2.tex`` default output 
 	:name: lst:matrix2-default

The reason for the problem is that when ``latexindent.pl`` stores its code blocks (see
:numref:`tab:code-blocks`) it uses replacement tokens. The alignment routine is using the *length
of the replacement token* in its measuring – I hope to be able to address this in the future.

There are other limitations to do with the multicolumn alignment routine (see
:numref:`lst:tabular2-mod2`); in particular, when working with code blocks in which multicolumn
commands overlap, the algorithm can fail.

Another limitation is to do with efficiency, particularly when the ``-m`` switch is active, as this
adds many checks and processes. The current implementation relies upon finding and storing *every*
code block (see the discussion on :ref:`page page:phases <page:phases>`); it is hoped that, in a
future version, only *nested* code blocks will need to be stored in the ‘packing’ phase, and that
this will improve the efficiency of the script.

You can run ``latexindent`` on any file; if you don’t specify an extension, then the extensions that
you specify in ``fileExtensionPreference`` (see :numref:`lst:fileExtensionPreference`) will be
consulted. If you find a case in which the script struggles, please feel free to report it at (“Home
of Latexindent.pl” 2017), and in the meantime, consider using a ``noIndentBlock`` (see
:ref:`page lst:noIndentBlockdemo <lst:noIndentBlockdemo>`).

I hope that this script is useful to some; if you find an example where the script does not behave
as you think it should, the best way to contact me is to report an issue on (“Home of
Latexindent.pl” 2017); otherwise, feel free to find me on the
