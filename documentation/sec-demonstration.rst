Demonstration: before and after
===============================

Let’s give a demonstration of some before and after code – after all, you probably won’t want to try
the script if you don’t much like the results. You might also like to watch the video demonstration
I made on youtube (“Video Demonstration of Latexindent.pl on Youtube” 2017)

As you look at :numref:`lst:filecontentsbefore` – :numref:`lst:pstricksafter`, remember that
``latexindent.pl`` is just following its rules, and there is nothing particular about these code
snippets. All of the rules can be modified so that you can personalise your indentation scheme.

In each of the samples given in :numref:`lst:filecontentsbefore` – :numref:`lst:pstricksafter`
the ‘before’ case is a ‘worst case scenario’ with no effort to make indentation. The ‘after’ result
would be the same, regardless of the leading white space at the beginning of each line which is
stripped by ``latexindent.pl`` (unless a ``verbatim``-like environment or ``noIndentBlock`` is
specified – more on this in :numref:`sec:defuseloc`).
