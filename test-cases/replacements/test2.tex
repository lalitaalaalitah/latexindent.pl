	When%%%%
	\announce{2018-01-13}{showDecorationStartCodeBlockTrace feature for log file} either of the
	\texttt{trace} modes (see \cpageref{page:traceswitch}) are active, you will receive
	detailed information in \texttt{indent.log}. You can specify character strings to
	appear before and after the notification of a found code block using, respectively,
	\texttt{showDecorationStartCodeBlockTrace} and \texttt{showDecorationFinishCodeBlockTrace}. A demonstration is given in
	\vref{app:logfile-demo}.

	The log file will end with the characters given in \texttt{endLogFileWith}, and will
	report the \texttt{GitHub} address of \texttt{latexindent.pl} to the log file if
	\texttt{showGitHubInfoFooter} is set to \texttt{1}.
